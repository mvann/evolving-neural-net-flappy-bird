# evolving-neural-net-flappy-bird
This is a program written in C that includes a Flappy Bird clone and an evolving neural net that learns to play it.  
It's not the cleanest code that I've ever written but I wanted to throw it together as mostly a proof of concept for myself. The net seems to be running to be reaching a local maximum and as a result only gets good at the game to a point. Were I to replicate this project I would use python and a better graphics library.
